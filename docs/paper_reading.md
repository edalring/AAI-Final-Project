# Learning Stable Classifiers by Transferring Unstable Features

The paper "Learning Stable Classifiers by Transferring Unstable Features" focuses on developing stable classifiers in machine learning by addressing the issue of biased models. Bias is a human-defined concept that varies across tasks, and algorithms often struggle to distinguish between stable (causal) and unstable (spurious) features based only on input-label pairs. This work leverages the observation that related tasks often share similar biases to inform the target classifier about unstable features in the source tasks.

The method involves two main steps:
1. **Identifying Unstable Correlations**: This is achieved by contrasting the empirical distribution of different environments in the source task. By analyzing these environments, the method identifies unstable correlations that exist across them.
2. **Learning a Representation for Unstable Features**: The method learns a representation, denoted as \( f_Z(x) \), that encodes the unstable features \( Z(x) \). This is accomplished through metric learning, which effectively captures the nature of these unstable features.

The approach aims to achieve robustness in the target task by clustering the target task data according to the derived representation and then minimizing the worst-case risk across these clusters. This methodology is applicable to both text and image classifications and has been empirically shown to maintain robustness on the target task, whether in synthetically generated environments or real-world environments.

# Invariant Risk Minimization

The paper "Invariant Risk Minimization" introduces a novel learning paradigm called Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). This approach aims to estimate nonlinear invariant causal predictors from multiple training environments, enabling out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization【15†source】.

### Methodology
The core idea of IRM is to learn correlations invariant across training environments. This involves finding a data representation, denoted as Φ: X → H, such that the optimal classifier w on top of this representation is the same for all environments. The method hinges on the concept that for certain loss functions, like the mean squared error and the cross-entropy, optimal classifiers can be represented as conditional expectations. This concept is used to discover invariances from empirical data, aiming for representations that predict well and elicit an invariant predictor across various environments. The method is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, aiming to minimize the risk across these environments while ensuring that the representation elicits an invariant predictor【16†source】.

The paper also discusses the transition from the idealistic objective of IRM to a more practical version, IRMv1. This version translates the hard constraints of IRM into a penalized loss, balancing predictive power and invariance. The function D in the loss formula measures how close w is to minimizing the risk for a given representation Φ across the environments【17†source】.

### Implementation
For implementation, IRMv1 can be estimated using mini-batches in stochastic gradient descent. This approach allows for an unbiased estimate of the squared gradient norm, a crucial component in calculating the loss. The paper includes a PyTorch example in Appendix D, demonstrating how IRM can be implemented practically【18†source】.
